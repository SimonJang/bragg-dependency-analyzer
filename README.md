# bragg-dependency-analyzer
Python script to analyze the dependencies in a `bragg` project

# TODO
- exclude node modules folder
- Exact search for the string from the `config.json`
- Include JS files if it's not a typescript project
- Retrieve the service name from the `package.json`
- Use `package.json` dependencies to check from `bragg-route-invoke` and `typescript`
- Map other AWS dependencies
- Create graph based on the data from the dependencies analysis
- Work with bragg powered SDK
